Hi, I’m Arshita 👋  

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with an interest in building practical software and understanding how systems work. I enjoy learning by working on projects, contributing to open source, and improving my problem-solving skills step by step.

## My journey so far  

I’m currently pursuing Computer Science with a focus on Data Science at Manipal University Jaipur. Alongside my coursework, I spend time exploring different areas of development and computer science fundamentals.

I started contributing to open source through **Social Winter of Code**, where I worked with mentors and other contributors to fix bugs and improve features using Git and GitHub. This experience helped me understand collaborative development and real-world codebases.

I was also selected as an **Internshala Student Partner**, where I worked on campus outreach and student engagement initiatives, promoting skill-based learning among students.

Apart from this, I’ve been involved in college-level activities like **Startup Mela 3.0**, where I was part of the core hospitality team and worked closely with others to ensure smooth coordination during the event.

## Projects  

**HealthSync**  
A centralized healthcare management system aimed at bringing patient data from different hospitals and clinics onto a single platform. I worked on building RESTful APIs using Flask to manage records and designed a React-based dashboard for real-time access and updates.

**Weather + Mood App**  
A web application that provides real-time weather updates along with AI-generated mood suggestions. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API and is designed to be easily extendable for future features.  
Repo: https://github.com/Arshita1510-coder/Weather-mood-app  

**Java Projects**  
Developed a Car Rental System using Java and object-oriented principles to manage bookings, returns, customers, and availability. I’ve also built smaller Java applications like a calculator, to-do list, quiz app, and note-taking app to strengthen my fundamentals.
